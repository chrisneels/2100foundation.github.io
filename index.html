        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>2100 Foundation (2100F) is a project building upon the dissertational work of Chris Neels at University College London.</p>
        <p>2100F aims to help address a systemic issue faced by technologists: how technologies are often developed faster than we can foresee, understand, and mitigate their negative implications. The result is often entrenched technologies with undesirable, unintended consequences.</p>
        <p>2100F will be publishing resources that help technologists critically reflect upon, and design for, how their technology impacts society over the long-term. These resources are a synthesis of academic research from science and technology studies (STS), anthropology, sociology, philosophy, management science, and design. Tested with practitioners developing and studying emerging technologies, F2100 resources are designed to inform decision making of a range of actors — including developers, designers, strategists, managers, executives, and social activists.</p>
        <p>Through these efforts, F2100 champions a more mindful approach to how technology is developed. While the resources may raise more questions than they answer, 2100F hopes it may expand the set of possible futures you may work towards, accentuate the legacy of your technologies, and avoid an entrenchment of outcomes that we all would be best to avoid.</p>
        <p>Our core team is Chris Neels (research), James McMillan (communications), Dr Jack Stilgoe (advisory).</p>
